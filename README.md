# Rotating Image Gallery

A 3D rotating image gallery built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Images rotate automatically every 3 seconds, and users can navigate manually using **previous** and **next** buttons.

## About

This project demonstrates a **perspective 3D carousel effect** using `transform: rotateY()` in JavaScript. Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to customize, and can be used in portfolios, product showcases, or any website where you want a visually appealing image gallery.

### Features

- 3D rotation effect for images
- Automatic rotation every 3 seconds
- Manual navigation via "Prev" and "Next" buttons
- Simple, clean, and lightweight

### How It Works

The gallery uses a rotation angle `x` that changes when the user clicks **prev** or **next**, or automatically every 3 seconds. The images are rotated along the Y-axis using CSS `transform` with `perspective` for a 3D effect.
